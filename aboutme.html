                I Know a bit of coding... I can code in C#, C/C++, Java, JavaScript, Python. I was never fond of English And have been bad at it since School, So don't bully me nerd!.
                <br>Was born in the Great Britain. and am 25... Was and still am bad at english, tho I do like Math and Science. Social studies is fine but i don't recomend it. I would rather like under a rock than study any language. Und Ich Kann deutsch Sprechen! Yea I took German instead of french cause I am an idiot. I like saying<span class="w3-tag w3-light-grey">Nerd</span> a lot.
                <br>Tho I still wish, I could learn french some day. I like to go mountain climbing and I did buy a paramotor, so am going to fly in that one day say "Hi" to me when I will be flying over you, Nerd. And yea I learned some coding and am going to release my first project lmao. Which I made a Year ago.<br>
                <br>There are thing that haunt me... The worst thing is pinapple on pizza... sometimes i just start to think that it is kind of good. It is like I get possesed... jk Nerd! I like to joke a lot even when it is not funny so don't bully me and I haven't spent hour trying to come up with something to write here in the perfect order...
