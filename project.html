      <h4>2D Player Controller</h4>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">A 2D player Controll Which I made a while a while ago(A year nerd)... Project file are available for download on my Github Page. There is Air resistence when player crouches and jumps at the same time. I will try to update and add more things into the mix but for now it can do basic stuff.
          <br>P.S. It may be the worst Player controller possible but it works and I really dont know of any Bugs if they exist...
